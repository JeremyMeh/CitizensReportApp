<h1> Title: Citizensâ€™ Report </h1>
<h2>
Problem Statement: Citizens will be able to report problems throughout their community.
  
Description: The Citizens Report application would allow users to make posts, see posts, view posts destination, and edit posts.
  
The problem: Citizens throughout a community often lack an ability to communicate with each other effectively. This could cause problems throughout the community such as safety hazards, violence, and a higher crime rate. People need a good way to communicate with each other throughout their city. They also need to be able to pinpoint the exact location of a problem that is being caused around the city.
  
The solution: Citizen's report app will allow users to create posts to notify others of issues who also use the app to keep others updated.
